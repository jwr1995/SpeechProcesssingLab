    "To gain more insight in changes of the spectrum over time we split a long signal into segments and compute the DFT for each of these segments. This is known as the [short-time Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform) (STFT).\n",

Starting from $k=\\ell L_{\\mathrm{hop}}$, the signal $x[k]$ is windowed by $w[k]$ to a segment of length $L_w$. This windowed segment is then transformed by a DFT of length $L_{\\mathrm{DFT}}$.\n",

The resulting spectrum $x[n,\\ell]$ depends on the frequency index $n$ and the block index $\\ell$ which is directly related to the time index $k$ by $k=\\ell L_{\\mathrm{hop}}$. The spectral domain is therefore also termed as [time-frequency domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%E2%80%93frequency_representation) and techniques using the STFT as time-frequency processing.\n",

    "The size $N$ of the segments and the window function influence the spectral and temporal resolution of the STFT. The block-time index $\\ell$ of the STFT can be increased by an arbitrary step size. The step size determines the overlap between two consecutive STFTs. For instance, the spectra $x[n, \\ell]$ and $x[n, \\mu+1]$ have $L_{\\mathrm{hop}}-1$ overlapping samples. The overlap is sometimes given as percentage of the segment length $L_{\\mathrm{DFT}}$."
